## About

Hi! Thanks for coming to the site - hopefully, we'll get to meet in person.

My name is Eric Arthur Conway Jr. (E.J.) The past few years, I've spent my time working as
a marketing strategist and most recently, marketing analytics program manager at Electronic Arts/EA Sports.

Now, I've spent the past few months honing my skills as a full-stack web developer.
I'm versed in frontend, backend, and database languages listed above, including React, JavaScript, Ruby, and SQL.
I've also got a few projects to share, showcasing this experience. Take a look!

I'm looking for work today, so I'd love to chat. Feel free to reach out via email,
LinkedIn, etc. Thanks!
